# LinearAlgebra
Practicing my linear algebra by making some C++ libraries for it
### test.cpp
A very basic C++ file to test the libraries I've created. A good place to look for example usage.
### Vec2.hpp
Standard 2D vector library
### Vec3.hpp
Standard 3D vector library
### VecN.hpp
Vector library generalized for N-space
##### Todo:
- [x] Vec2
- [x] Vec3
- [x] VecN
- [ ] Projections, angles between vectors, vectors from angles, etc
- [ ] Quaternion
- [ ] Other math concepts?
- [ ] General math library for intersections, distance, etc.
- [ ] Use an actual testing framework (e.g. gtest?)
